t was Thursday afternoon in Gadsden, the Alabama hometown of US Senate candidate Roy Moore. Jones, 38, a social work student, is vehemently opposed to the maverick Republican and finds the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against him compelling.
Helms, however, intends to vote for Moore. “They’re trying to drum up some garbage to discredit him,” he contended over a cigarette. “There might have been some sort of incident – totally innocent, human, man and woman – and people got out there and exaggerated and blew it out of all proportion.”
The disagreement is typical of Gadsden, an understated, churchgoing city of 36,000 people on the Coosa river where the grapevine has been buzzing of late. Interviews by the Guardian with 20 residents on Thursday uncovered a wide spectrum of views, from diehards who stand by Moore to Republicans who are wavering because of the scandal to critics who loathed his firebrand populism from the start.
Behind Jones and Helms’s seat was the modest law office of Leroy Cobb, who was wearing a long and thick white beard, a tie patterned with the Confederate battle flag and a baseball cap with a picture of Confederate general “Stonewall” Jackson and the words “southern heritage”. Breaking off from a client meeting, Cobb, 69, insisted that he could not contemplate voting for Doug Jones – bidding to become the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Alabama in a quarter-century – over Moore on 12 December.
“On the one side you’ve got a man who believes in using taxpayer money to murder children and give sodomites equal rights,” he said. “On the other you’ve got a man who doesn’t believe in those things. I’m a Christian and my Bible doesn’t teach those.”
Dismissing the allegations against Moore, he added: “Forty years ago? They never told anybody or nobody believed them? What does that tell you about what kind of women they are? If it was my daughter, I would have killed whoever did it. I don’t believe them.”
