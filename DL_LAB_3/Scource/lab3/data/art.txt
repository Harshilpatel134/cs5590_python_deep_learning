Salvador Dali’s Mae West Lips sofa, one of the most famous pieces of furniture of the 20th century, could be taken out of the UK unless a buyer willing to pay almost half a million pounds is found.
The British government has placed a temporary export bar on Sofa, which Dali created with Surrealist poet and collector Edward James.
A buyer will have to be found before May to match the asking price of £480,281 plus £16,600 VAT for the red sofa to remain in Britain.
The 1938 piece of furniture has been described as the most famous object in the history of Surrealism. The lips relate to Dali’s paintings and drawings that were inspired by Hollywood star Mae West.
Five of the sofas were made in total, with the version on sale altered by James, with the lips elongated, to make it an integral part of the Surrealist interior of Monkton House in West Sussex.
The temporary export bar follows a recommendation by the reviewing committee on the export of works of art and objects of cultural interest.
